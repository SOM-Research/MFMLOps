# MFMLOps

A framework for modeling ML-based software development processes.

The framework provides a graphical tool for process modelers to design their own AI/ML development processes, which includes assets for representing activities, artifacts, resources and roles. Those entities have been identified and designed from a literature review on best and actual practices.

We have built our framework on top of the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/emf/).

Additional features have been included, such as:
- A BPMN exporter that converts the process model into a BPMN 2.0 compliant file that can be run by any compatible business process automation platform.
- An HTML documentation generator that creates a single navigable document including all the information extracted from the different entities within a process model.

## Installation
